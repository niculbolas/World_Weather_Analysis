# World_Weather_Analysis

## Overview of Weather Analysis:
The purpose of this project was to randomly select cities from around the world using their coordinates and then find the local weather conditions using appropriate API's.  Next a statistical analysis was performed using linear regression to determine if lat/long are correlated to temp, wind speed, humidity, or cloud cover.

The next part of the project was to ask for user input on preferred temperature ranges for a vacation and then to narrow our list of randomly selected cities down to those that are in the user's preferred temperature range.  From there, the closest hotel to the randomly generated coordinates was selected and then a vacation was planned using the Google Directions API to plan the users vacation to multiple cities.
